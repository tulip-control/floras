# Contributing to Floras

If you want to modify floras or contribute, you can install it directly from source as described [here](installing.md). We are using [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) to manage the dependencies. If there are problems installing floras, please create an issue on GitHub.

If you need to add any new dependencies you can do that by running:
```
pdm add your_dependency_here
```
